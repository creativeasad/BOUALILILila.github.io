I'm a PostDoc Research Fellow at the [Laboratoire d'Informatique de Grenoble (LIG)](https://www.liglab.fr/en) at the [University of Grenoble Alpes](https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/). I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the [University of Toulouse III - Paul Sabaiter](https://www.univ-tlse3.fr/) in 2022, where I was a member of the [IRIT](https://www.irit.fr/en/home/) lab.

My research interests include Information Retrieval (IR) and Natural Language Processing (NLP).
